# civ4-modding
This site is tutorial to create mods for Civilization 4 Beyond the Sword.

It's very basic, static : it's my first site that I created while learn html5/css3.
I used php function "include" for presentation. But I posted a zip file with html/css only for persons who would want to see the site without php server.
